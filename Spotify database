# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. First i wanted to find the artist the track name and how danceable the track is and see how popular is the track limiting to the top 10.

SELECT artist_name,track_name,popularity,danceability
 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 ORDER BY popularity DESC 
 LIMIT 10;
 
 #2. then i notice that Olivia Rodrigo was the #1 artist in the top 10 but i wanted to know how many songs she had in the whole database.
 
 SELECT artist_name,track_name,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name ='Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

#3. I want determined the avg loudness, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

SELECT artist_name,track_name,avg(loudness),avg(danceability),avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
