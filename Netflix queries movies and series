#1. how many movies do we have in this database? (movies only nothing else)
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

SELECT MAX (DATE(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3.List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id
WHERE nt.title='American Psycho';
