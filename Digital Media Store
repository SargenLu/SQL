# in this code im going to be looking at some tables from a digital media store for music that has different tables with information about the customer
employees, artist, songs, albums, time and date of when it was bought,location and invonces

# 1 first i will like to know how many customer made a purchase that are located in the USA, with the date of the pruchase, to know if they are frecuent buyers
or new buyers

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "USA";

# 2 Now lets look at the customer that are not from the US

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

# 3 knwoing this now i will like to know what countries are customer buying from so in order to do that i will have to search the invoices and locate 
the countries 

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices ;

# 4 I will like to know the invoices associated with each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.Lastname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

# 5 NOw lets look at the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers, I will organize it by country so i can
track the regions where Employees are doing the best 

SELECT emp.FirstName AS 'Employee First name', emp.Lastname AS 'Employee Last Name', cust.FirstName AS 'Customer First Name', cust.LastName AS 'Customer Last Name', cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
