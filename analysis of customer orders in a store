#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about products,customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iphone';


#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in January
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers CUST
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.JanSales JAN
ON CUST.order_ID= JAN.orderID;

#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


 #6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,product,SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
ORDER BY product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 3 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(CUST.acctnum),AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
 LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers CUST
 ON FEB.orderID=CUST.order_id
 WHERE FEB.quantity > 3;
